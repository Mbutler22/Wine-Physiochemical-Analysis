# Wine-Project:
 

## Project Overview

We will leverage data from two datasets, related to red and white variants of the "Vinho Verde" wine, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (e.g. fixed acidity,	volatile, acidity,	citric acid,	residual sugar	chlorides,	free sulfur dioxide,	total sulfur dioxide,	density,	pH,	sulphates,	alcohol	%, quality) by using various Machine Learning Models.  
As mentioned in the resource, there are only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables available (e.g., there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
We will try to use models to select most relevant variables by testing feature selection methods.

* Optional: https://www.kaggle.com/christopheiv/winemagdata130k
Use selected variables from this data set (price, region, country...), to build the machine learning model to 
be able to predict quality of wine.

## Project Outline

1. Shuchi  - ETL: Extract Data from : csv files, json
2. Dasa/Tinu/Joshua - Use Pandas Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and selection of 
the features for input to machine learning models
3. Dasa/Joshua/Tinuola - Machine Learning : we plan to use LinearRegression, 
RandomForestClassifier, Deep Neural to train models and evaluate 
models using testing data to choose the model with highest 
performance score 
4. Melissa/Dasa/Joshua - HTML/CSS : build up webpage with user data selection based on our features 
5. Shuchi/Megan - Tableau: â€“ visualization :( Red Wine Visualization - Shuchi)
6. Dasa/Joshua/Melissa - Flask
7. Megan - Heroku
