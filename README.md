# wine-project:
 

## Project Overview
We will leverage data from two datasets, related to red and white variants of the "Vinho Verde" wine, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests using various Machine Learning Models.  
As mentioned in the resource, there are only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables available (e.g., there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
We will try to use models to select most relevant variables by testing feature selection methods.

## Project Outline
1. Melissa - ETL: Extract Data from : csv files, json
2. Dasa/Tinu/Joshua - Use Pandas Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and selection of the features for input to machine learning models
3. Dasa/Tinu/Joshua - Machine Learning : we plan to use LinearRegression, RandomForestClassifier, SVM, KNN (plus unsupervised models) to train models and evaluate models using testing data to choose the model with highest performance score 
4. Melissa/Shuchi/Joshua - HTML/CSS : build up interactive webpage  
5. Shuchi/Megan - Tableau: â€“ visualization 
6. Joshua - Flask
7. Megan - Heroku
